# Hi Mr Examiner =D
<hr />

This file is here so you know how my code should be ran.

Since I am using a script type module element in most of my pages, you would need a live server to run it.
```js
<script src="file.js" type="module"></script>
```
(It looks like that)

If you do want to run this code on your machine, you can:
  - Run this on a NodeJS server(files already included) by using:
  ```shell
    user@computer:~$ npm i
    user@computer:~$ npm fund
    user@computer:~$ npx vite
  ```
  - Access the website through my GitHub page
