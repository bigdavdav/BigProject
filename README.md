# Hi Mr Examiner =D
<hr />

This file is here so you know how my code should be ran.

Since I am using a script type module element in most of my pages, you would need a live server to run it.
```js
<script src="file.js" type="module"></script>
```
(It looks like that)

If you do want to run this code on your machine, you can:
  - Run this on a NodeJS server(files already set up) by using:
  ```shell
    user@computer:~$ npx vite
  ```
  - Access the website through my GitHub page
  ```
    https://bigdavdav.github.io/BigProject/index.html
  ```

I would reccomend you to run it through a NodeJS server rather than checking the GitHub website, as the website might have a malfunctioning image(issue I faced when testing the website) even though the NodeJS server didn't have anything missing.

If you can't run it on a NodeJS server, that is completely fine. Please do keep this in mind though if you see any missing images.
